Ensure that you've read through the extensions guidelines and follow the best practices for creating your extension.

## Working with Markdown

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux).
* Toggle preview (`Shift+Cmd+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux).
 I'm already using that keystroke, damn
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux, macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets.
